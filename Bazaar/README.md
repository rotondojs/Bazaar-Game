This folder contains the design and implementation of the Bazaar game.

The folder contains:
- The Common sub-folder, containing the classes and data representation which are shared between all actors in the Bazaar game.
- The Referee sub-folder, containing the classes and data representations specific to the referee.
- The Planning sub-folder, containing design memos for each element of the Bazaar game.

Future actors can be added in separate folders, and can all reference the Common folder to ensure the data representation is the same across the code.
